# ShopifyChallenge
This is my solution for the Shopify Developer Intern Challenge. The code has been deployed on aws. Click on the following links to use the functions of the program.

For delete image, you must enter and the charactertics of an image to delete it from the repository. For find image, you enter a keyword such as db or service and the program will output a list of pre-stored images in the program with that word in its name. This list does not include images added by users.
