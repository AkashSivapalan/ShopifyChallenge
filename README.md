# ShopifyChallenge
This is my solution for the Shopify Developer Intern Challenge. To run this file, you can execute the jar file as a java file. Make sure port 8081 is free on your device running 
it. When the jar file is ran, you can enter these urls into your browser to execute the programs functions:

http://localhost:8081/ShopifyChallenge/image/addImage
http://localhost:8081/ShopifyChallenge/image/viewRepository
http://localhost:8081/ShopifyChallenge/image/findImage
http://localhost:8081/ShopifyChallenge/image/deleteImage
